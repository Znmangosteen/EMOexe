abstract = "This paper examines the interpretability-accuracy tradeoff in fuzzy rule-based classifiers using a multiobjective fuzzy genetics-based machine learning (GBML) algorithm. Our GBML algorithm is a hybrid version of Michigan and Pittsburgh approaches, which is implemented in the framework of evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO). Each fuzzy rule is represented by its antecedent fuzzy sets as an integer string of fixed length. Each fuzzy rule-based classifier, which is a set of fuzzy rules, is represented as a concatenated integer string of variable length. Our GBML algorithm simultaneously maximizes the accuracy of rule sets and minimizes their complexity. The accuracy is measured by the number of correctly classified training patterns while the complexity is measured by the number of fuzzy rules and/or the total number of antecedent conditions of fuzzy rules. We examine the interpretability-accuracy tradeoff for training patterns through computational experiments on some benchmark data sets. A clear tradeoff structure is visualized for each data set. We also examine the interpretability-accuracy tradeoff for test patterns. Due to the overfitting to training patterns, a clear tradeoff structure is not always obtained in computational experiments for test patterns."
