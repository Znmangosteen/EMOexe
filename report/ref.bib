abstract="Arc Routing is the arc counterpart to node routing in the sense that focus regarding service and resource constraints are on the arcs and not on the nodes. The key problem within this area is the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP), which is the arc routing counterpart to the vehicle routing problem. During the last decade, arc routing has been a relatively active research area with respect to lower bounding procedures, solution approaches and modeling. Furthermore, several interesting variations of the problem have been studied. We survey the latest research within the area of arc routing focusing mainly on the CARP and its variants.",
