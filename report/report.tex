  \section{Introduction}
  In this project, we aim to build a parallel distributed implementation of a multi-objective genetics based machine learning(GBML) algorithm. We choose a specific problem of a three-objective fuzzy rule-based classifier and fit it into a hybrid GBML framework. Then we develop a parallel mechanism to accelerate computation.

  Code of the three parts have been completed. We will integrate them together, fix bugs and run some test problems in the next stage.

  \section{Fuzzy Rule-based Classifiers}
  The design and implementation of fuzzy classifier is based on \cite{ishibuchi2007analysis}.
